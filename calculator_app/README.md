# Calculator app

The app is not 100% functional. Here are some aspects which don't work properly: 
- the "." button doesn't do anything
- the app takes into account only the last operation symbol entered. Example: if you tap 5 + 3 - 2 = , the app will display 3 (result of 5-2)
- numbers which are too big will go off-screen and will generate a display error at the edge of the screen

That's pretty much it! Other than that, all good :)
